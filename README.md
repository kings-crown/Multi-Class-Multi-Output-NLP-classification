# Multi-Class-Multi-Output-NLP-classification
n this study, we construct a machine learning framework to perform multi-class, multi-output classification of text-containing documents using Natural Language Processing. We use two feature extraction methods (IF-IDF and Word2Vec), and compare the performance of five traditional classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), and Support Vector Classifier (SCV)) with the Deep Neural Network (DNN). Our results indicate that the Decision Trees classifier performs the best with an AUC of 86% and an F1 score of 0.76 outperforming the DNN.
